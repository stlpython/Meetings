At LinkedIn we have over 500 engineers working on Python products every day. Everything from machine learning, to command line utilities, to highly performant web services.

In this talk I will cover a wide variety of the challenges that come with managing a Python ecosystem, as well as some of the strategies we've used at LinkedIn to deal with them.

Expect to hear about things like: managing a dependency graph, interop with non-Python services, distribution of command line utilities and application performance. Plus many other topics!
