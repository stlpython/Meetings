Slack and Python: Building a HeyTaco-like Slack integration bot with Python

Slack is a team messaging platform which a rich API that allows for a range of programmatic interactions making it a prime candidate for various types of bots and integrations. HeyTaco is one such integration that allows users to give Taco emojis to teammates. Total tacos received by each user are stored, and a leaderboard displays who has the most at any given time. Recently, HeyTaco became a paid integration, so we decided to write our own clone using Python.

This talk will go through the code (available on Github) and explain the Slack API it uses, as well as give an overview of the data processing and storage models, and the how response messages are built. The application is designed to be customizable via environmental variables, which will be demonstrated via a live deployment on Heroku. Attendees will be able to interact with the live model during the presentation (if they join the free slack team). Additionally, if the participants have a free Heroku account, they will be able to deploy a version of the application (without persistent storage) directly from Github. The presenters will be available after the presentation to help.

Github: TBD

Slack Team: TBD
