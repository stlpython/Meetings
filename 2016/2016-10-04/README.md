Load testing is probably one of the most important practice to incorporate into any infrastructure because otherwise you're just guessing what instance size to use and how many you'll need. Lots of tooling exists here: ab, beeswithmachineguns, jmeter, etc. While I've tried all of these I always find weird situations where I need a bit more... I need to do signed oauth requests, I want to load test a non-http service, etc. Going beyond simple http load testing is tricky. Enter Locust.io.

Locust.io is an open source framework that lets you define tests with python code and while there's out of the box http handlers you can do practically anything you can do in python. In this talk I'll give a demo of running locust.io on many boxes and load testing everything from http services to memcached.
