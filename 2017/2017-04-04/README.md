As humans, the majority of the information we receive each day is in visual form but we don't realize how terribly bad we are at correctly processing that information, especially when it's in a context that violates our normal assumptions about the world around us. No where is this more apparent than when we try to teach computers to see for us. From satellites to MRIs, we rely more and more on computers to gather information about the world around us and distill it into 'truth'. Image processing/computer vision is concerned with how image data is managed, manipulated, and converted into actionable information. We'll go over many of the major tasks of image processing using SimpleITK, rasterio, scikit-image, and OpenCV using Jupyter notebook for visualizing our results.

About the speaker:

Dave began his college education intending to become the next Great American Writer. Unfortunately, during an argument with his Writing I instructor, he had the epiphany that literature was not his calling. After a brief love affair with political science and the realization that lying for a living is hard, he graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a BA in Physics. During this time, he was first exposed to radiation physics and imaging which captured his heart. During his master's work at the U of Iowa, he studied Biomedical Engineering, focusing on medical imaging and automated image processing of brain images in CT and MRI. He recently worked for UrtheCast writing software to process and analyze satellite images.
