Gene expression data is dense and variable from experiment to experiment. Also, each experiment will be focusing on different points. Attempting to write a generic program that would be able to parse the expression output would be extremely tedious, and not likely portable across experiments. Jupyter, along with Pandas for data structures and Seaborn for plotting, offers an excellent platform for exploring the data and visualizing on the fly. This will be a walk through of one of these experiments and some of the features of Jupyter, Pandas, and Seaborn that simplify this process

Mark is currently working as a Computational Biologist at the Danforth Plant Science Center studying bacterial disease in cassava and cotton through differential expression analysis and other sequencing data.
