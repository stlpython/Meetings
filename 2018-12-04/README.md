Anvil: Web apps with nothing but Python


 Tuesday, December 4, 2018
 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM


 CET Showroom at CIC - St. Louis
 20 South Sarah Â· Saint Louis, MO


Presented by Stefano:


If you are a beginner you will learn how to build a website in a few minutes.
If you are an expert you will see that Anvil is not just for beginners: you can build UIs, APIs, interact with other servers (Raspberry Pi, your PC, a computer in your server room, etc.)


A few years ago I decided to build my first website: I learned Python, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, CSS. But SQL is too difficult to use, so I learned Peewee. But HTML is too difficult to generate, so I learned Jinja. But JavaScript is too difficult to use, so I learned JQuery. But... so many buts!
And when I finally had something working on my computer, I still had to learn how to setup a web server, a database server, firewall, security, authentication, ...


Then I met Anvil, where I can use Python code on the server side and on the client side and the rest (SQL, CSS, JavaScript, server, security, authentication, etc.) is taken care of. And if I need some fancy query or I want to create my own style I can still use SQL or CSS.


I will begin the session with an introduction to Anvil followed by a quick creation of an app. Then you will work on your own app. You can start from scratch on whatever you like or follow one of these three workshops:
