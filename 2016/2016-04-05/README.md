We'll be in the library on the second level behind the elevator bank.

The boto framework is the de facto for Python interactions with provisioning and configuring AWS Services. A new version has been released, that makes some changes to how you interact with each service, and how you orchestrate each piece. I've also noticed that standard boto will not be as heavily maintained going forward, and boto3 will keep up with new Service releases in AWS. Let's start up some demos and walk through some scenarios on how using boto3 can help things like Provisioning, Configuration Management, and Service Orchestration.

Greg Langston is a Senior Systems Architect at Connectria Hosting in St. Louis MO, and has been using Python exclusively for 10+ years. He was a Linux Architect at Rackspace for 3 Years as well, where he worked on the automation of Configuration Management, Remote execution, and Infrastructure as Code components and services.
