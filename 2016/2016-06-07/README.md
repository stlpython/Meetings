Presented by Dr. Bill MacMillan - Prattle CTO:

Classifying and evaluating unstructured text is a well plowed field. Presenting analysis of text to clients frequently involves both giving analysis of the text, and a variety of identifying pieces of metadata regarding a document. However, limiting evaluation to specific contexts within documents is a more involved exercise that requires combining abstract tools with low levels tools and an understanding of the process that generates documents. I present our methods of extracting metadata, and restricting analysis within structured text documents in a variety of machine readable forms.
