Talk Descriptions:

Talk 1 - Running Python on AWS Lambda with Zappa:
Servless architecture is rapidly becoming the standard of high-scale/no-infrastructure management application hosting. Zappa is a Python framework used to deploy microservices or full-stack Python applications to AWS using AWS API Gateway, Lambda, CloudFormation and CloudWatch. In this lightning talk, we will cover getting a full Flask application deployed and available in AWS Lambda using Zappa.

Talk 2 - Dave will discuss his experience and insights on youth tech education after four years volunteering with CoderDojo, founding two separate dojos - CoderDojo Iowa City and CoderDojoSTL, and working with organizations such as Codestarter, CodeDay, and Code.org. He'll discuss languages and tools he's found to be successful in engaging kids with coding. Lastly, he'll outline the good, the bad, and the ugly when it comes to tech education, from programs to gadgets to culture. Finally, he'll tell you why he keeps doing it.

If you're a cynic or a believer, there's something here for you!

Talk 3 - Jason Rahm will cover best practices around structuring your templates in Flask as well as getting your Flask application deployed to PythonAnywhere.
