October 2nd Meeting  
CET 1904labs, 20 S Sarah Street  
This is the same building as the Showroom where previous Python Meet Ups have been, but the 1904labs space on the third floor, north end of the building. Someone will be at the entrance to let you in, then go down the hallway between the main office and the glass wall for the co-working space until you reach the elevators. Take them to the third floor and walk all the way down the hallway to the last door on the left.
