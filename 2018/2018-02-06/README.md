Hack night and Python help session

Details
Hack night!

Need a night away from normal distractions to work on your project? Have something neat you'd like to share with others? Stuck on a problem that you just need to talk through with someone or get some helpful advice? This is the night for you!

We'll start the night by letting folks describe their project if they choose. If you have a problem you are trying to tackle, describe the issue - maybe someone in attendance can help! The rest of the night will be for you to work on your project or group discussions for solving each others' problems.

Come by to relax, program, and meet some other Pythonistas!
