Pandemic is a co-operative strategy board game whose gameplay consists of 2-4 players balancing their actions to simultaneously keep diseases at bay while also trying to discover cures and win the game. On each turn players have four actions they can use to move around the board, remove disease markers from the board, or meet game objectives by turning in cards and "discovering a cure." The board consists of a graph of cities (nodes) and routes (edges) between the cities. Players move from city to city along the routes. Turns and actions are limited, so efficient movement is essential to winning the game.

This talk will give an overview of Pandemic and present network analysis (performed with NetworkX) that yields insights into improving action/movement efficiency. It will then give an introduction to the NetworkX library covering its contents (e.g. what types of graphs are available, what algorithms are included) as well as basic usage examples.
