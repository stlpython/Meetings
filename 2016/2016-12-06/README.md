Apache Spark is a fast and general engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing. It can run programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory, or 10x faster on disk. It is almost becoming the de-facto platform to do petabyte scale machine learning. The presentation will cover the setup of Spark Clusters (1 Master, 2 or 3 slaves) using the spark-ec2 script, starting a jupyter notebook on the spark Master, connecting to the Jupyter notebook on the local machine, building an item-item Movie recommendation model using the MLib Collaborative Filtering machine learning model in Python. The machine learning model will be trained on the publicly available Movie Lens dataset (25 million rows of user-movie-ratings) using the Spark clusters in parallel. The trained product factors RDD will be pickled and then deployed as an API in a Flask application using a Rocket server. A preview of the deployed model can be seen at http://datasqz.com/movie-names/movie-similar
