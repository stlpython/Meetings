OpenStack's subunit2sql

Tuesday, August 7, 2018
7:00 PM to 9:00 PM

CET Showroom at CIC - St. Louis
20 South Sarah Â· Saint Louis, MO

In this talk, Trevor will cover openstack's subunit2sql project which can be used for converting subunit streams from test results into a database, how openstack uses it for displaying their test results and how AT&T adopts the same concept with a simple full stack demo that includes mysql, flask, angular (as openstack-health), and a jenkins pipeline to clone and produce test data.

Trevor is a python software developer at AT&T with 2.5 years of experience. He spent his first 1.5 years working on upstream OpenStack where he spent most of his time contributing to the networking and database as a service projects. He now works on a QA team for AT&T's OpenStack cloud API with a unique approach of consuming upstream testing projects by building containers to edit, configure, and install before running them against production.
