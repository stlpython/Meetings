As the amount of text data in the world explodes with emails, text messages, online journalism, social media, and many traditionally paper products moving to digital, the ability to extract meaningful information from the data in an automated way is becoming more necessary. Thanks to Python packages such as scikit-learn, NLTK, and gensim, text analysis is easy to learn and implement for a hobby or in production. This talk will cover the popular Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) text analysis technique for document analysis using scikit-learn. It will walk through the math behind the technique and then show several examples using Python to cluster and search documents. It will also briefly explore other applications for TFIDF.
