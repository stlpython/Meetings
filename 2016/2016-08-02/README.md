Apache Airflow (https://github.com/apache/incubator-airflow) is a workflow automation and scheduling system that can be used to author and manage data pipelines. It is written in Python and is used by many companies (startup -> public). It was originally written at AirBnB (http://nerds.airbnb.com/airflow/AirBnB). By defining workflows as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.
